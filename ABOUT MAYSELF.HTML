                    <br>I would like to introduce myself to the best of my ability. My name is Kirlstel Suela.I'm 20 years old. I'm a 1st year college student</br> 
                    <br> I study Bachelor of Science in Information System (BSIS). I live in Brgy. Katuparan Taguig City.I was born on September 02, 2001 at  <br>
                    <br>Koronadal City South Cotabato. I have one brother and he is a senior high school student and  two little sisters. My father died because<br>
                    <br>of illness and my mother is a housewife. My family is not perfect like others. Well, I just say that we are living well Ate 3x a day, wear <br>
                    <br>normal dresses. However, sometimes we did not expect some circumstances and trials that came into our lives. Although  we are not   <br>
                    <br> complete we did not lose hope instead , we kept  holding each other's hand, always pray unto God to support and never let go of us, and  <br>
                    <br>give us enough  strength  to face it. When my father passed away a lot changed and as an eldest child it was my responsibility to help my <br>
                    <br> mother  in taking care of my siblings so I went in manila to work. I still remember I was only 16 years old when I went to Manila to work <br>
                    <br>and I ended up studying in grade 10. While I was working I also saved money to study. After a year I enrolled in President Diosdado<br>
                    <br> Macapagal High School as a senior high school student. I know that as a working student life is not that easy your time is divided between <br>
                    <br>  work and study. But they say that nothing is difficult for a person with a dream. Then after graduating from senior high school I enrolled in<br>
                    <br> Taguig City University (TCU) as a 1st year college student. By the way i like baking because baking is my biggest stress reliever during my <br>
                    <br> hard times. Honestly, I don't like the course that I took but I couldn't do anything because it was what they wanted to take. Since I was <br>
                    <br> little , I wanted to be a chef because cooking makes me happy and also I love cooking for others .<br>
